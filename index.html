    <p id="visual-studio"> Visual Studio is an offline-based app where you use three coding languages: index.html, main.js, and style.css. It is very simple to use, with many tools and having the ability to test things in the app. There is complex coding involved, but it makes things much easier. </p>

    <p id="console-screen"> The console screen is a place where you can display things, but not in the actual website. Using javascript, you can code and put display text on the console screen. By clicking inspect, you can navigate there. First create a variable, and then console that variable. It is used to store information without displaying it on the actual website.  It allows for a simple user interface. </p>
